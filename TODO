date/time
	test allowBlank with range
		how does end date react when start date is blank?
		should treat it as startDateTime = minDateTime

	option to provide starting set of rules and filterFn
		how does "all" interact with individual rules?

	Chrome annoyance:
		setting <input type="time"> to zero blanks it instead of setting to 12:00AM
